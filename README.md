# story_arc_grapher
A narrative planning app for authors. Lets you keep story beats for each character organized, and save out projects
## Example Usage
Lets say you are writing a fantasy story with 6 main characters all starting in different towns. This app lets you track each character's personal story within a beat. You get to choose how granular this is: a beat can be a chapter, a minute, or a year.

If you decide a beat should be a flash back instead, you can easily move the order of the beats.

Eventually, I want the user to be able to export a word document so they can have an outline of their story to start writing with.

## MVP
*creating a roster of characters with basic info per character

*creation of a story beat

*inserting a beat into the existing series of beats

*move beats forward or backward in the sequence

*edit the character entry for a beat

*edit the title and synopsis of a beat

*save and load projects between sessions

*export a text document that functions as a story outline (planning on rich text format)

## Future Features
The MVP for this app is very basic, but the concept of a story planning app is a novel one. There are many cool ways I can expand this so that it is useful for more genres of writing, including writing for games (which requires you to track other deliverables and complex cause/effect systems such as flags, player progression, and the tech debt for each cutscene or audio log pickup).
